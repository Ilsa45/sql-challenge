# sql-challenge
This repetitive nature of this challenge helped me get comfortable with the use of PGAdmin and more specifically I took time to understand how to create tables using the query tool and importing files for local databases.
I came across some challenges regarding syntax for a few lines but the more time I spent on it the better I understood it.
